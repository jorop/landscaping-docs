# LandscapingInfos Actor

After opening the `Landscaping Tab` an Actor called `LandscapingInfos` is created in the scene. The Actor can be selected like every Actor in the World Outliner in the Unreal Engine Editor.

In the Details Panel of the Unreal Engine Editor you can see different section belonging to Landscaping. They mainly hold metadata so that the `Landscaping Plugin` can do it's work properly.

> Please do not delete the `LandscapingInfos` Actor as long as you plan to work with the `Landscaping Plugin` in the editor.

For packaging the project, the `LandscapingInfos` is not needed and can be deleted savely.
