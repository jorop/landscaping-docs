# Mapbox

With the extension [Landscaping Mapbox](https://www.unrealengine.com/marketplace/en-US/product/landscaping-mapbox) heightmap tiles from Mapbox can easily be imported.
Therefore only the extents (bounding box) of the area must be pasted into the [DTM import Options](heights?id=import-area-optional) dialog. The heightmaps will be downloaded automatically and the Landscape / World Composition / World Partition will be created.  
Please make sure to provide your Mapbox API key in `Project Settings -> Plugins -> Landscaping Mapbox`.
