Landscaping let you create rivers, streets, railroads etc. from Shapefiles with Unreal Engine 4 Spline Component. Here, like in the section about landcover, please see [Get Data](get-data.md?id=vector-data) what input files are suitable for this task. Generally, every Shapefile will do.

> Importing vector data from Shapefiles is meant to lay out a scene quickly. Depending on the quality of the Shapefile, it will or will not get you a final result. Post editing might be needed to adjust the generated splines or Blueprints, especially when generating spline Actors with Shapefiles from geofabrik.de.

## Generate from Mesh or Blueprint

> Please unload all tiles before proceeding

1) `Select` a Shapefile  

> If no Landscape is found in the scene, it is possible to create a dummy landscape with no extents here.  
> If a Landscape was not imported through the Landscaping plugin, a popup will appear prior to selecting a Shapefile:  
![Shapefile Anchor](_media/ue4_landscaping_anchor.jpg)  
> a. `Select LandscapoingInfos.txt` let you set the GIS anchor from a textfile, which was [exported prior with PNGs](heights.md?Ã¬d=only-convert-to-pngs).  
> b. `Autodetect` trys to set the CRS (Coordinate Reference System) and anchor from the Shapefile. This will not match the landscape, but with the LandscapingInfos Actor in the World Outliner, the Anchor can be moved to match the shapes with the Landscape - see [Enable Vector Debugging](gis-expert.md?id=draw-vector-data-debug).  

2) Define what should be generated along the lines of the imported Shapefile:  

    a. Select at least a `Spline Segment Mesh` or  
    b. Select a `Blueprint` or Actor. The Blueprint has to have a spline component attached or must implement [LandscapingVectorInterface](landscapingvectorinterface.md)

3) `Offset from Ground` specifies how much space will be between the surface of the Landscape and the point of the spline or instantiated Bluprint/Actor
4) `Start Segment Mesh Scale` and `End Segment Mesh Scale` is the scale factor applied to the spline mesh width.
5) `Revert Spline Direction` can be used, if a river is imported and flows upstream. This can happen, if the shape from the Shapefile is drawn in the wrong direction. When [Draw Vector Data Debug](gis-expert.md?id=draw-vector-data-debug) is enabled, you can zoom in and see an arrow on the first segment of the shape, indicating the direction.
6) With `OSM feature class` you can control, what type of features will be instatiated with the Blueprint or Spline. A river should have another Blueprint than a stream and a path another Blueprint than a highway. This dropdown let you select the apropriate feature class of the shape for the Blueprint which should be instantiated on the Landscape.

> Please make sure to unload all Levels of a World Composition (except the Persistent Level) in the Unreal Engine `Levels` tab before hitting `Import`

7) Hit `Import`
