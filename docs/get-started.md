1) Open the Plugins window (Edit -> Plugins)
2) Scroll down until you find 'Landscape' and select it
3) On the 'Landscaping' plugin check the checkbox next to 'Enabled'
4) Unreal Engine asks you for a restart
5) After Unreal Engine has restarted, you should see the Landscaping Icon in the toolbar:

## Import Heightmap

1) Download the example heightmap [example.tiff](https://cloud.ludicdrive.com/example.tiff), or use another GeoTiff file.
2) After clicking on Landscaping on the toolbar, the Landscaping tab pops up:

3) Hit the `Select` button and choose your tiff file
4) Then hit the `Import` button and the landscape from the height raster will be transformed into a Unreal Engine landscape within a few seconds
5) That's it
