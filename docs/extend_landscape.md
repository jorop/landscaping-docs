# Extending Landscapes

The plugin provides the ability to extend a Landscape. This is not the recommended way, but it may be useful if vast Landscapes should be created iteratively.

> The recommended way is to import large areas at once

Normally, the Select button is greyed out if a Landscape already exists in the World. If it is a World Partition World, additional Landscapes can be imported.  

It is possible to extend with other raster files (GeoTiff, etc.) or with Mapbox by selecting an area in the DTM Import Options.

> Using different sources may result in overlaps or gaps between landscapes. To resolve this, Landscapes can be moved to match up.
