# Extending Landscapes

The plugin provides the ability to extend a Landscape. This is not the recommended way, but it may be useful if vast Landscapes should be created iteratively.  

> The recommended way is to import large areas at once  

It is possible to extend with other raster files (GeoTiff, etc.) or with Mapbox by selecting an area in the DTM Import Options.

> The size of a landscape will always be the size of the first imported landscape. The resolution however can be altered by uncheck `Resample to first tile`.  
> Using different sources may result in overlaps or gaps between landscapes. To resolve this, Landscapes can be moved to match up.
